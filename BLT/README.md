# DBLT project
## Context

The "Bio and Living technology" class focus on the fabrication process of sustainable technologies from two perspectives: Low-Tech (simplification of technological processes) and Bio technologies (materials sourced from living organisms). 

As a reminder, this project can be a part of your year project, technological expedition, or any other project, as long as you prove that **YOU** made and evaluated it. You can use a single project to validate different class projects, as long as it matches each class's requirements.

This class project has to be made alone. However, it doesn't restrict you from asking for bits of advice or work with your peers. A project or a part of a project cannot be presented twice or more (for different people).


## Instructions

The following instructions are the necessary conditions to present a project. 

Instructions :
- Use 1 Bio-sourced material ( kombucha, mycelium, clay... )
or
- Deploy one simple process to fabricate your project that uses a low tech approach and/or reclaimed materials
and
- Perform a  characterization of your prototype or samples, and how it resists to different stimuli (strength, resistance to humidity,... )

> You must choose the characterization for the second phase (November).

## Deadlines

The evaluation process has three steps (detailed in your survival guide).
**the documents have to be written in English.**

### Step 1 - Subject validation


You have to provide a 1-page report which summarises your project and the process to make it. Optionally, a brief paragraph about the link between your project and your Group. 
The deadline is for the report. You have to check with the course instructor and the PI before if the project meets the instructions. 
As a reminder, some information on what to write are available on the template.  As a general guide, write clearly: 
 * The project summary
 * A description
 * Why? 
 * How? 'Or' What? 
 * Interest in doing it this way?
  * If possible a mini moodboard to understand the aesthetic mobilized and the direction of the project. 

The quality of the report is a part of the evaluation. Make it readable with relevant pictures. 


### Step 2 - Avancement


You have to provide a report (between 2 and 5 pages) which summarises your advancement. The report is an extension of the first one. You will present your progress and prototype(s) to the course leader during a 10-minute meeting. The meeting has to take place in the deadline interval. 
**Please take the meeting in advance (1 week in advance, not 1 hour)**

### Step 3 - Final result


You have to provide a report (between 5 and 10 pages, please no more) which summarises all the projects. You have to add figures, schematics, and all resources mandatory to understand the project. You will present your final result with a demonstration to the course leader during a 10-minute meeting. The meeting has to take place in the deadline interval.
**Please take the meeting in advance (1 week in advance, not 1 hour)**

## Others

Don't forget to clean your place after work and put away all tools and materials used.
