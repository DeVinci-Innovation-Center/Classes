## Context
The objective of the course is to discover and master the fundamental tools on which all software, programs and a growing part of the modern world are based. The course starts from the most fundamental elements of modern computing and leads to current topics of a higher level of abstraction. These lessons will discuss the principles present on all computer systems and tools commonly used to develop any type of application.

## Course Objectives

The course is structured like a zoom out over several weeks. Students will start by learning the fundamentals of computer science to take a step back and see more varied areas of application and tools. The first courses focus on concepts such as processes, memory, processor instructions. Once these concepts have been acquired, the following courses lead to an overview of the development tools and techniques used in production environments. These concepts include, among others, APIs, C and python programming languages, containers and virtualization, databases, concepts of Cloud. Attention is also paid to the security issues of automation of processes, in particular with the discovery of tools like Ansible but also network courses, systems administration and a superior introduction to cryptographic techniques.

## Evaluation

The evaluation will be done in 3 phases:

- In **Phase 1** you will explain how you plan to use HP skills in your year project. 
```
Phase 1 MUST be done in this order:
* First, explain to me the idea you plan to implement in your year project to validate HP. I will look for the different skills involved and if they are related to HP.
* Second, formally ask your PI to validate the idea. The PI will make sure the skill are in accordance with the group vision and compatible with your yeah project.
* Finally explain your idea using the provided LaTex template and post the PDF on the "Rendus Cours > HP" channel of the DVIC Discord.

The submission deadline for phase 1 is set to the 23rd November 11:59:59PM (23 Novembre 23h59min59sec).
```

❗❗ **Please note** ❗❗ Only PDF using the template will be accepted for all phases, all other formats will be rejected. The submission deadlines are strict, no documents will be accepted after the deadline.


- In **Phase 2** you will detail the different steps to achieve the goal set in phase 1. You will complete the PSSC grid to make your self-evaluation in the next phase. This phase requires technical information about the different components of your project. The deadline for phase 2 is set for the 7th of December 2022 23:59:59PM (7 Décembre 2022 23h59min59sec)

- In **Phase 3** you will complete the template with the evaluation of your prototype according to what you submitted in phase 2. Phase 3 must have an evaluation of the technical characteristics of your prototype or a user study. The deadline for phase 3 is set to the 17th March 2023 23:59:59PM (17th March 2023 23h59min59sec)
