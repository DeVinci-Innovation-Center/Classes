## Context
The objective of the course is to discover and master the fundamental tools on which all software, programs and a growing part of the modern world are based. The course starts from the most fundamental elements of modern computing and leads to current topics of a higher level of abstraction. These lessons will discuss the principles present on all computer systems and tools commonly used to develop any type of application.

## Course Objectives

The course is structured like a zoom out over several weeks. Students will start by learning the fundamentals of computer science to take a step back and see more varied areas of application and tools. The first courses focus on concepts such as processes, memory, processor instructions. Once these concepts have been acquired, the following courses lead to an overview of the development tools and techniques used in production environments. These concepts include, among others, APIs, C and python programming languages, containers and virtualization, databases, concepts of Cloud. Attention is also paid to the security issues of automation of processes, in particular with the discovery of tools like Ansible but also network courses, systems administration and a superior introduction to cryptographic techniques.
