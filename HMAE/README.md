# HMAE Notation
## Context

The "How to Make Almost Everything" class focus on the fabrication process and electronics. As a result, the notation will mainly focus on the fabrication process you used and the fabrication of an electronic board. 

Your notation is based on a part of your year project or technological expedition and you must prove that **YOU** made the evaluated parts. You can use a single project to validate different class projects, as long as it matches each class's requirements.

A project or a part of a project mustn't be presented twice or more (for different people). It leads to a 0 and a report to your specific PI.

## Instructions

The following instructions are the necessary conditions for the notation.

Instructions :
- 3 different fabrication processes must be used (3D printing, molding, laser cutting, forging, etc...). For each one, you must provide your modelizations, molds, plan, etc...
- A functional electronic board made by yourself. We must find at last one microcontroller on it. 

> If you want an exception, ask the course leader and your PI.

### Product Specific Success Criteria (PSSC)

For the firt step of notation (see section "deadlines"), you will have to write a PSSC. Commonly say, a PSSC is a goal you want to achieve and the reward you estimate for it. The notation of your project is depend of the notation sheet in the survival guide and your PSSC. To write the PSSC, you must define a precise goal to your project (ex: Make a humanoide robot which can walk in straight line alone) And different sub-goals (ex: It must stand on his 2 foot, each foot can move, it can stand on 1 foot). The main goal is the maximum note (20/20), the sub-goals are parts of this note, each one give an amount of point decided by you, the sum is equal to the maximum note. If your main goal and sub-goals are not ambitious enough or too much ambitious, you will have a reduction of the maximum note (20 -> 16 -> 12). 


## Deadlines

The evaluation process has two steps (detailed in your survival guide).
**the documents have to be written in English.**

### Step 1 - Subject validation

> 12/11/2021

You have to provide a report (between 2 and 4 pages) which summarises your project and the process to make it. You have to add your PSSC (See section "Notation Sheet") and explain how you intent to make your project.
Your project **must be decided with your PI** and the course leader. Otherwise, your report could be rejected, ending with a note of 0.
The deadline is for the report deposit. You have to check with your PI and the course leader before. 

The quality of the report is a major part of the evaluation. Make it readable with relevant pictures. You can send it beforhand to your PI or the course leader for advices. (Gifting cookie increase the quality and amount of advices)


### Step 2 - Final result

> 17/12/2021 - 18/12/2021

You will present your final result with a demonstration to the course leader during a 10-minute meeting. The meeting has to take place in the deadline interval.
**Please take the meeting in advance (1 week in advance, not 1 hour)**

## Others

Don't forget to clean your place after work and put away all tools and materials used.
