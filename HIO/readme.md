# HIO Project
## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

In the HumanI/O class, you will be exploring novel forms of human computer interaction (HCI) as well as the parallels and divergences between humans and machines through the creation of your own projects.

Inspired by the model of ‚ÄúVision Based Research‚Äù by Hiroshi Ishii, the central requirement of HIO is for students to clearly articulate the vision for their project. The vision expresses not only *what* is created by *why*. It is a way of seeing the world, which enables you to map a research space and identify worthwhile areas of further inquiry. In the context of HIO, your project is a concrete manifestation of your vision, serving as a vehicle to inspire the imagination of others in the possibilities of your ideas. 

HIO does not require you to learn specific technological tools. You are free to decide for yourself what tools to learn to build your project and to strengthen your technological repertoire. On a meta level, HIO is also about interrogating your own learning through the creation of your Innovation Project and the acquisition of new skills. You are your own ultimate project, and you will be asked to reflect upon your own development as a human throughout the course.


## Types of Projects

All projects in DVIC will involve some sort of research question, some technological implementation, and some sort of validation. HIO projects can be positioned into 3 broad categories based on the nature of their contribution. I will be evaluating your work based on how you choose to position it. Your project can certainly cover more than one category if you wish to articulate more than one type of contribution.

### ‚Äçüî¨üìù Understanding the Human:

You are creating and/or evaluating an artifact that sheds some light on some aspect of some human capability or experience. You could create a device that enables the measurement of something.  You could also propose a new experience and get data on how it affects people. It is also possible to implement a human capability in a machine as a way to model and make explicit what humans might be doing ‚Äúunder the hood.‚Äù

I will be evaluating ‚ÄúUnderstanding the human‚Äù projects on the research questions you ask, your sense-making of existing work, your hypotheses, and the interpretation of the data you collect. 

### üß†üèÉInterfaces to help people learn:

You are creating/advancing an interface or tool that help people learn one or more specific subjects. You will not only create a functioning system but also envision and create demos of subject-specific scenarios and document how people interact with the demos.

I will evaluate ‚ÄúInterfaces to help people learn‚Äù projects on the quality of scenarios that you envision and prototype. You will be expected to carefully observe how people interact with your system and to propose areas of potential improvement for future iterations of your system.

### üí°‚ú®Artistic Expression/Experiences

You are creating an interface or an experience that raises new questions about how humans can interact with the concrete world and abstract worlds of knowledge. The most successful projects will propose new perspectives and create curiosity. 

I will evaluate ‚ÄúArtistic Expression/Experiences‚Äù projects on new questions that your project raises and its overall aesthetic experience.


## ‚úÖ Checkpoint 1: October 7th, 2022

For first checkpoint, please provide a 1-2 page PDF document with the following information:

A paragraph about your Project, including the following information:
- What do you plan to build?
- Why is it interesting/important?
- What has already been done in your direction of inquiry?
- How is your approach different?
- Category-specific information based on how your position your project (e.g. research questions, scenarios)

A diagram of your project:
- What are the components of your project? 
- How do components connect to each other and what technical skills do they require?

A plot of your pathway forward: (drawing or chart)
- What are your intermediate steps to creating your project?
- What are points of potential difficulties, and how do you plan to address them.

A paragraph about your own learning:
- In what areas will this project develop your skills?
- What is your plan for developing those skills? (tutorials, people you will talk to)
- What other projects could you do with the skills you develop through your project?
- Who can you collaborate with? (optional but encouraged)

## ‚úÖ Checkpoint 2: November 20th, 2022, end of day

Please provide a report (between 2 and 5 pages) that summarize the progress on your HIO project. The report can include materials from your previous report and should include the following sections:
- Abstract: summary of context/motivation, problem statement, solution, methods, proposed evaluation (200 words max) 
- Introduction: a more elaborate description of the context/motivation, problem statement, and what you are planning to do 
- Related work (SOTA): several paragraphs summarizing areas of prior work relevant to your current project. 
- Detailed architecture of your project:
   - Include a diagram of the parts of your project, the tools entailed to implement each part, and how they connect
   - If your HIO project is only a part of your innovation project (this is the case for a lot of A5s), you should still show the diagram of your IP and derscribe how your HIO project relates to it.
   - Describe and justify any design and technical choices that you had to make
   - Criteria for success
- Preliminary evaluation plan:
   - Provide initial research questions that you would like to investigate through your project
   - Present some ideas for what kind of evaluation your will conduct (quantitative or qualitative?)
   - If quantitative, what will you measure and analyze?
   - If qualitative, what kind of questioinnaires and interviews will you conduct?     

If you are not in HLG, please make sure that your advisor validates your proposal over email. If you are in HLG, and haven't updated me since the week of Nov 7, please take a 10-15 min meeting with me over Outlook for validationn. I will accept advisor validations until Nov 25.

For administrative reasons, your HIO reports must be different from your IP reports and must have a different focus. If your IP is about building a device, your HIO project can focus more on the evaluation. Feel free to discuss with me if you are unsure of how to divide your projects for different classes.
